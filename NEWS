sinaplot NEWS

Changes in version 1.0.0 (2016-10-11)

- Major graphic update. SinaPlot now uses "base" graphics instead of ggplot2.
  geom_sina() is now part of ggforce (https://github.com/thomasp85/ggforce),
  an extention of ggplot2, and can be used to produce sinaplots with ggplot2.

- Major functional update. Several parameters have been added, renamed, replaced
  or removed.
  Read below for details.

  Added:
  - "maxwidth" confines the spread of the samples along the x-axis. 0 is
  equivalent to no spread, 1 allows for maximum spread.
  - Any argument can be passed to plot(), e.g. "cex" = 0.8, "pch" = 20, etc.

  Renamed:
  - Method "neighbourhood" is renamed to "counts".
  - "neighbLimit" is renamed to "bin_limit".
  - "groupwiseScale" is renamed to "scale".

  Replaced:
  - "yFraction" is replaced with "bins". Instead of specifying the fraction of
  the data range for each bin, now you provide the number of bins.

  Removed:
  - "xSpread".
  - "labels" .
  - "main", "bw", "shape" and "size".

- If "plot == FALSE" the function returns a data frame with columns:

  x: discrete x-coordinates, split by group
  y: input values
  group: input groups
  bin_count: number of samples per bin per group
  scaled: final x-coordinates, adjusted by the sinaplot method

================================================================================

Changes in version 0.1.6 (2016-07-08)

- Fixed a bug where having samples values overlapping the outermost y-bin
  boundaries produced an error (thanks to John Hoch).

Changes in version 0.1.5 (2016-05-14)

- Fixed a bug that was plotting the first and last classes beyond the figure
  margins.

Changes in version 0.1.4 (2016-04-19)

- Fixed a bug where the data were reordered after calculating the new x-axis
  coordinates. This was creating problems when a user wanted to plot the samples
  with custom colors using sinaplot() + geom_point(col = mycol).


Changes in version 0.1.3 (2015-11-20)

- "groups" are treated as factors and they are plotted in the order that their
  levels appear (alphabetically by default) providing a similar output format with
  default ggplot2 plots.

Changes in version 0.1.2 (2015-10-02)

- NEWS file added.
- Changes in vignette compiling. knitr is added as the vignette builder in the
  DESCRIPTION FILE.
- Author details edited.
- Removed redundant "inst/temp.R" file.
